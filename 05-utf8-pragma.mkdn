# The `utf8` pragma

The *sole* use of the `utf8` pragma, as in:

    use utf8;

at the top of your file, is to tell perl that the rest of the file,
notably the string literals, is encoded in UTF-8. That's all. (My
personal advice, however, is to avoid putting UTF-8 in your files,
unless you're extra-sure it's not going to be mangled by editors,
terminals, and co-workers.)
